# Digital Image Processing Using Verilog

## Overview

A Verilog-based digital image processor implementing multiple image enhancement and transformation operations using behavioral modeling. The system supports eight operations, selectable via a 3-bit operation code, and utilizes Block RAM (BRAM) for image data storage and retrieval. MATLAB is used for `.coe` file generation and conversion between image formats.

## Supported Operations

| Operation Code (`[2:0]`) | Operation |
|--------------------------|-----------|
| `000` | Brightness Increase |
| `001` | Brightness Decrease |
| `010` | Grayscale |
| `011` | Red Filter |
| `100` | Green Filter |
| `101` | Blue Filter |
| `110` | Thresholding |
| `111` | Inversion |

## Key Features

* Implementation of core image processing algorithms using Verilog behavioral modeling.
* Use of **Block RAM (BRAM)** for efficient pixel-level data handling within the testbench.
* Parameterized design allowing easy addition of new image processing operations.
* MATLAB integration for `.coe` file generation and image conversion.

## BRAM Generation in Xilinx Vivado

1. Create a new BRAM IP in Vivado.
2. Rename if necessary.
3. Set data width to **24 bits** (8 bits each for red, green, and blue channels).
4. Set depth slightly greater than the total number of pixels in the image (e.g., for a `500Ã—400` image, depth > `200,000`).
